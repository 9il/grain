Mir is a generic framework for scientific computing; it does not know anything about computation graphs, or deep learning, or gradients. However we can easily use mir to fit a two-layer network to random data by manually implementing the forward and backward passes through the network using mir operations:"

    "\n",
    "In the above examples, we had to manually implement both the forward and backward passes of our neural network. Manually implementing the backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer network, but can quickly get very hairy for large complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we can use automatic differentiation to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The autograd package in grain provides exactly this functionality. When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a computational graph; nodes in the graph will be `Variable`, and edges will be functions that produce output Variable from input Variable. In addition to Slice feature, Variable contains autograd history (simply previously forwarded `Function` object that also implements its backward function) as `grain.autograd.Backprop` type. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients. Moreover, unlike mir.ndslice only supports CPU memory slices, grain supports both CPU and CUDA memory slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds complicated, itâ€™s pretty simple to use in practice. Each Slice represents a node in a computational graph. If x is a Slice that has x.requiresGrad=True then x.grad is another memory holding the gradient of x with respect to some scalar value (and x.gradSlice hold a slice of the gradient).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use `grain.autograd.Variable` and autograd to implement our two-layer network; now we no longer need to manually implement the backward pass through the network:"
